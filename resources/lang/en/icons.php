| An overlay, not a second source of truth. `name` and `description` are
| deliberately absent: IconRegistry::fromDirectory() reads those from
| resources/assets/svg/config.json, which is canonical. Keeping a copy here
| is what let the two drift apart in the packs that already had a lang file,
| while nothing was reading it. A non-English locale may add them to
| override; `en` must not.
|
| Variant keys match Simtabi\Laranail\Ichava\IconSetsFlag\Enums\Variant.
