> Country flag icons for the Ichava Laravel icon ecosystem — 542 SVGs in `4x3` and `1x1` ratios, vendored from `lipis/flag-icons`.

This package is not published to Packagist, so there is no registry-version badge to show. Requires [`ichava/core`](https://opensource.simtabi.com/documentation/ichava/core/); targets PHP `^8.4.1 || ^8.5` on Laravel `^13`.

## Install

```bash
composer require ichava/icon-sets-flag
php artisan ichava::ichava-core.database seed --package=ichava/icon-sets-flag
```

The seed is not optional — until it runs the registry holds no rows for this pack and every lookup returns nothing. See core's [installation guide](https://opensource.simtabi.com/documentation/ichava/core/installation).
